Today 13/11/2025:
I just got started on a new project for project based learning like two days ago and today i am seeing real progress.
Today I fixed everything in the code

To do list for 14/11/2025:
--Fix the bus where only one file loads at a time
--And i think that is IT...!!

Today 14/11/2025:
I tried to fix the for loop problema and realised that i need so append the files to a list as a dict in order to loop over them all, the problem with the previous code was that it was re-iterating or rewriting everything as the iteration went on. Now I have really solved the bug and came up with the raw structure of the File Sorter.

To do list for 15/11/2025:
--Leave comments on every code explaining what it does.

Today 15/11/2025:
In the morning I left comments on half of the code, pushed the code into the main File-Sorter python file instead of test.py. I also deleted testtest.py which was used to test the code of the test.py file.

Today 18/11/2025:
Three days break and finally back programming, just doing light tasks today. Moved the miscellanious folder thing into the else statement, commented on every code, and that is it.

To do list for 19/11/2025:
Nothing, the project is done HOORAYY.....!!!
Time for a new project.
